## What is a critical success factor?

A critical success factor (CSF) is a management term for an element that is necessary to achieve success.

  * A CSF drives the strategy forward.

  * A CSF makes or breaks the success of the strategy.

  * When all the CSFs are combined, they are sufficient for success.

Choosing the right CSFs needs good understanding of what is important to the organization, to the industry, and to the customers.

  * Critical success factors are the essential elements of a strategy for success in a particular business in a particular industry at a particular time.

  * Strategists should ask "Why would customers choose us?" and the answer is typically a critical success factor.
